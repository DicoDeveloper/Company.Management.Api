# Company.Management
The project aims to develop a basic company registration system using Asp .Net 8 and Angular 18. This system will employ CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) architecture to separate command and query operations. Backend operations will be managed using Asp .Net 8 with Sql Server and EntityFramework for robust relational database management. Additionally, MongoDb will be utilized specifically for API query procedures, handling non-relational data storage needs. The system will be designed following Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles to ensure a clear and maintainable domain model architecture. Angular 18 will provide a dynamic and responsive frontend interface for seamless user interaction with the system.

This project was generated with [Asp .Net Core 8](https://learn.microsoft.com/pt-br/aspnet/core/release-notes/aspnetcore-8.0?view=aspnetcore-8.0) version 8.0 and [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.0.7.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build
